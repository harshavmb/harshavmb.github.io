      <description>Introduction Venice (Venezia in Italian) is a city in the Northern Italy along the Adriatic sea on the East. It is also called as &amp;ldquo;The Floating City&amp;rdquo; as it was built on top of lagoons. As Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day was approaching, we wanted to visit a place where we can spend sometime together at a romantic place. Also, Carnival was happening that time which further excited us.
Travel We drove from Erding via Salzburg via A8, E55 motorways.</description>
