      <description>Introduction The Rhine Falls is the largest waterfall in Europe by volume of water, with an average flow rate of 1500 cubic meters per second. It is located in the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen, on the border with Germany.
The falls are formed where the Rhine River flows over a rocky ridge, creating a 150-meter-wide (490 ft) and 23-meter-high (75 ft) drop. The water plunges into a narrow gorge, creating a thunderous roar that can be heard for miles around.</description>
