      <description>Introduction The Chiemsee is the largest lake in Bavaria and the third largest lake in Germany. It is located in the southern part of the state, in the Chiemgau region. The lake is surrounded by mountains, which provide a stunning backdrop.
The Chiemsee has three islands: Herrenchiemsee, Frauenchiemsee, and Krautinsel. Herrenchiemsee is the largest island and is home to the Herrenchiemsee Palace, which was built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria.</description>
